# Circuit-Simulator
React and Flask - Simulate a simple DC circuit

Check it out on [Heroku](https://circuit-simulator.herokuapp.com/)

Usage
-Try placing a power supply and then some resistors and wires that connect from the positive and negative terminals of the battery
-If you have wires connecting the positive and negative terminals of a powersupply directly you will short the battery! (and the results will be mostly meaningless)
-Power supplies / Resistors / Wires can only be placed between horizontally or vertically connected neighbors.
